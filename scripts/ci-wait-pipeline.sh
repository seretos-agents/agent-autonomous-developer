# CI wait for process-developer Phase 6: resolve the project-issues CLI by
# EXECUTING a candidate (on Windows / Git Bash the bare name can resolve to a
# Linux ELF next to project-issues.exe -> rc 126/127), then pass the CLI's
# stdout and exit code through unchanged. If no candidate is executable, exit 4
# (the documented "CLI unusable" lane -> list_pipeline_runs fallback).
# Usage: ci-wait-pipeline.sh --project <id> --sha <sha> --timeout <s>
